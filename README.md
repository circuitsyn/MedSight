# MedSight
Remembering medical flare ups and regularity of symptoms can seem like such a nuicance, but with this application, each user can consistently track symptoms, severity, location and outside influences affecting day to day quality of life and well being, taking back ownership of their personal health.

Once loaded onto the MedSight Landing page, each user is met with a myriad of symptom selectors to choose from( such as location, pain level and stresslevel). The page automatically loads with data on each users locations ( only once it had been authenticated by each user), including the pollen level, humidity, air quality, and temperature.



## Submit New Card
On the landing page is a greeting Quote of the Day and a blank card to fillin with symptoms experiences, as well as the autofill information about outside information, specific to the user( such as pollution, pollen count, temperature, and humidity).

## Card Submissions
Upon submitting each filled out card, MedSight transitions over to the card stack, populated with the users previous cards, which can then be sorted by both stress and symptom level.

## Dashboard
Sliding over to the dashboard page shows the relationships between the data that has been captured by each card.
